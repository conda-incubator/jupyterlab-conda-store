### 1. Pre-flight checks

- [ ] Ensure there are no [open issues with a `block-release ‚õîÔ∏è` label](https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22block-release+%E2%9B%94%EF%B8%8F%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

### 2. Prepare the codebase for a new release

- [ ] Create a new git branch for the release `git checkout -b release-2023.11.1`
  - [ ] Prepare the branch with `git clean -fxdq`
- [ ] Bump the version in the `package.json` file
- [ ] [Optional] Update the `conda-store-ui` version used in the extension:

  ```bash
  jlpm up @conda-store/conda-store-ui@<version>
  ```

- [ ] Update the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file with the new version, release date, and relevant changes [^github-activity].
- [ ] Check the version locally with `hatch version`
- [ ] Build and test locally (see the [RELEASE.md file](https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store/blob/main/RELEASE.md) for more details)
- [ ] Make a release commit: `git commit -m 'REL - 2023.11.1'`
- [ ] Push the release (REL) commit `git push upstream main`
- [ ] If a **release candidate** is needed, tick this box when we're ready for a full release.

  - In the **`Target:`** dropdown, pin it to the release commit you've recently pushed.
  - Add release notes in the field below [^github-activity]; you can copy/paste the Changelog from the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.
- [ ] Confirm that the release completed
  - [The `release` GitHub action job](https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml) has been completed successfully in the [actions tab](https://github.com/conda-incubator/jupyterlab-conda-store/actions).
